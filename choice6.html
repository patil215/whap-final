            <h1 class="cover-heading">Keep trying to fight</h1>
            <p class="lead">Desperate not to get caught you fight like a caged animal kicking and scratching at your captors. They hold on to you dragging you out of the office and down the hall. In a last ditch effort to escape to bite the presidents leg with all the strength that you have left. He lets out a scream, letting go of you in the process, and grabs his now gaping leg wound. You jump to your feet and start running away. Behind you, a siren starts to wail and you hear what you think to be dogs. You keep running straight until you reach a dead end. in front of you is a large bay window with what looks like a twenty foot drop. As you turn to find another exit the president as well as 10 or so guards round the corner guns raised. “ END OF THE LINE!”, shouts the president as he holds his pistol out in front of him. By the look on the men's faces it doesn’t look like you're going to to be getting away in one piece. You decide you have only one option.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">In an instant you turn to the window and jump through it. The guns of the guards light up the night sky and and as you fall you feel and stinging pain in your shoulder. You land on the ground and bolt away from the house, gunfire licking at your heels. You run into the city looking for a place to hide and lay low. As you look around you see building after building with countries flags on the front. It takes some time but you finally find the building with the Russian flag and push open the door. Inside the building was what looked like a receptionist desk with a short bored looking Russian man sitting behind the counter. As you begin to collapse the man runs up and catches you. “You don’t have to worry comrade. You're among friends.” is the last thing you hear before you pass out.</p>
