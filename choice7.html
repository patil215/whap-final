            <h1 class="cover-heading">Try cutting your restraints</h1>
            <p class="lead">You can’t stay here and die like a dog. Forcing yourself to ignore the pain coming from the gash in your head, you begin to cut the straps holding you to the chair.  As you saw away at your restraints, you feel a pair of eyes glaring at you so you stop, but once you hear the steps go away, you resume cutting your restraints.  The hum of the engine continues as you cut back and forth, back and forth.  The process is monotonous, and you’re getting tired but you continue on.  After what feels like hours, you break free.  Taking off your blindfold, you’re shocked because you’ve been sitting in an airplane.  You look around and don’t seem to see anyone around but just to be safe, you palm the shard of glass from your bottle. Slowly you make your way along the cold pale white walls, trying to move as quietly as possible. As you make your way thru the halls you constantly look over your shoulders, fearing that one of your former captors would find you. As a round a corner you find a sign, in english and russian, that reads “RUSSIAN PRISONER WING. PROCEED WITH CAUTION”.  As you begin to walk away from the hall you hear an alarm begins to whine. Seeing no way to escape you run toward the section of the prison marked for Russian Prisoners.
            <p class="lead">Running quickly you come to a set of double doors at the end of the hall. Behind the double doors you hear hundreds of men yelling “ Free us!”.  Opening the doors you run in the room a search for a way to open the cells. Just when it seems hopeless you are able to make out a button the looks like a tiny man opening a cell. You press it and to your amazement, you actually free the prisoners. The prisoners let out a heroic shout and charged out of their cells with makeshift weapons. One the prisoners, who later introduced himself as Vladimir, promised anything in return for your help. You ask for Vladimir’s help in retrieving the launch codes and he doesn't hesitate to lend you his aid. You use the ensuing battle as a distraction while you follow Vladimir around the prison. Finally you arrive at an unmarked door. As you search the room you find not only the launch codes for the Turkish nukes, but the launch codes for most of the United States’ nukes. You can now return home a hero. </p>
