            <p class="lead">Seeing no way to escape your inevitable death you what any person who had angered someone else would do. You turn to face the younger man and in your best best english you say the only phrase that you remember from your training. “I’m sorry”. To your surprise the look on the president’s face changes from one of anger to one of surprise. “Excuse me?!” he replied in russian “Are you apologizing?”. “Yes. Is that against some american custom?”, you answer rather confused at how the president can speak russian so well. “It’s just…I’ve never met a Russian that wasn’t a cold hearted killer trying to fight everyone around him.”. The president stares at you sympathy filling his eyes. “You don't really fit in with most Russians do you?”. You admittedly answer no and then tell him about the problems you’ve been having in Russia. After talking for about thirty minutes the conversation then turn to what will happen in the future. “ Well we can’t let you go back to Russia and i’m pretty sure you don't want to stay in Russia. How would you feel like defecting to the United States!?”. At first you are apprehensive think of what would happen if you were to defect. Slowly you begin to realize that unfortunately no one would miss you. Your mother and father would probably be happy that you didn't have to deal with your constant complaints over how they adored your brother and your wife would probably love the check that widowed wives received. You turn to the president, a smile breaking across your face. “I think that sounds great!”.
