            <p class="lead">Slowly, you make your way up to the gate of the large white house. Around the large white house you see armed men patrolling the fence. Quickly but quietly you jump the fence and make a beeline for the front door.  As you start running, your thick coat gets caught on part of the fence.  You had left your knife with the remains of the dog, and you now only have a gun you smuggled into the United States.  As you reach for your gun, you hear voices coming closer and closer.  There’s no time for you to shoot.  They would discover you.  On impulse, you tear yourself from your jacket leaving behind all your personal possessions including your passport, gun, leaving you with only your vodka bottle and a signed picture of Kremlin.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">You slide the door open and move inside the massive structure. Around you, the walls are lined with pictures of old men that you don't really recognize. Suddenly, from behind you hear a pair of voices. You begin to run deeper into the large house looking for the way out.  It’s nighttime, so thankfully, the house is dark, and you feel calmer as you run further and further away from the voices.  The padded carpeting beneath your feet is soft, and you feel like you could just curl up and sleep.  It’s been almost 20 hours since you last sat down, and your legs are ready to give out.  As you round a corner you find yourself at a set of double doors.  You’ve reached a dead end, and you have nowhere else to run. You reach into your pocket finding only an empty vodka bottle and the signed picture of the Kremlin that you got for Christmas.</p>
            <p class="lead">You see a small nook where you think you can sit and wait till you catch your breath.  Your heartbeat slows down, and you feel ready to continue, but you have no idea what to do.  You stare at the double doors in front of you, and you feel a rush of adrenaline course through your veins.  You know that you could always turn around and fight the homeowners.  You’ve always had an impressive left hook but you could also take your chances and burst through the door.  You never know what could happen.  Putting your ear to the door, you only hear the fast but steady beat of your heart.  Do you play it safe and burst through the doors or do you go and fight the homeowners? </p>
