            <h1 class="cover-heading">Burst through the door</h1>
            <p class="lead">You burst through the door using your picture of the Kremlin as a lock pick. Inside the room, you are barely able to make a desk in the dark overcast night. You jump under the desk and hide as the pair of voices walk into the room. As you look over the desk you see two men. One of the men seems to be younger while the other seems to be in the later years of his life. As you lean in to get a better look at the two men your shoulder bumps into a button under the desk. The two men stop arguing and run toward the desk forcing you out of your hiding spot. Before you can run the younger of the two men grabs you by the shirt and slams you against the wall. Your head hurts and you struggle to keep your eyes open.  You feel a sticky liquid run down the back of your head, and you pinch yourself to stay conscious.</p>
            <p class="lead">In the dark night you’re barely able to make out the man’s face. You slowly realize that you are getting beat up by the President of the United States.</p>
            <img src="img/jfk.gif">
            <p class="lead">You appear to have yourself in control, but you’re internally freaking out.  You’ve just blown the mission that was supposed to be your redemption.  You’re frozen in spot as people around you scream in a language you don’t understand.  You’re snapped out of your shock when, in Russian, the president calls you an idiot as he proceeds to beat you with your vodka bottle.  You’re handcuffed, and brought to your knees.  Do you start apologizing or do you pretend that you’re having a heart attack and fall to the floor?</p>
