            <p class="lead">It’s 1962 and the height of the Cold War. It has been four years since you caused a commotion at Checkpoint Charlie and you’re the laughingstock of the KGB. After shots fired with your boss, it was decided that you would be sent to the United States on a top secret mission to find the launch codes for some missiles placed in Turkey.  Your boss is stressed out, and that isn’t helping your case.  Instead of putting you on a flight with a fake passport to keep your identity safe, you’re put on a Russian Stealth Sub headed to somewhere in the United States.  The problem? You not only don’t know where you are, but you also only speak Russian. By the time you swim to shore from the Russian Stealth sub, you are cold, hungry, and out of vodka. You stumble around, and then you pass out.  The last thing you see is a small Eiffel tower, and you wonder whether you’re in France.

            <p class="lead">When you wake up, you’re even hungrier than before.  You see a sign with a couple of weird looking squiggles on it.  It says “Welcome to San Francisco.”  Going to the nearest convenience store, you find a map and on the map, you see the same squiggles… hallway across the country in California. You realize that you now have to take a transcontinental trek in order to get to your final destination… Washington D.C.  While only surviving on grass and random insects you find, you hitchhike for weeks until you finally arrive in D.C. Looking around, you see a big white building. You haven't eaten for the whole day. You're so hungry you could eat a bear, but would you risk blowing your cover to get something tasty? Your stomach growls and you decide you can’t wait any longer.</p>
            <p class="lead">You walk slowly but surely around the perimeter of the building while watching out for any dogs.  You always hated those vile little creatures so given the chance, you would eat one.  Suddenly, your worst nightmare comes true.  You hear feet racing towards you and without thinking, you grab your knife and stab it through whatever that was headed towards you.  It was a dog.  It looked like you would be getting dinner that night, but your future was looking bleak.  You had to get into the building soon or else your boss would terminate you.</p>
