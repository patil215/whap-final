            <p class="lead">It’s 1965 and the height of the Cold War. It has been four years since you caused a commotion at checkpoint charlie and you’re, by man the laughingstock of the KGB. After shots fired with your boss, you were sent to the United States on a top secret mission to find the launch codes for the missiles.   The problem?  You not only don’t know where they are, but you also only speak Russian. By the time you swim to shore from the Russian Stealth sub, you are cold, hungry, and out of vodka. Looking around you see a big white building.  You haven't eaten for the whole day.  You're so hungry you could eat a bear, but would you risk blowing your cover to get something tasty?</p>
