            <p class="lead">You take your vodka bottle and break it against the doorframe next to you. You let out a ferocious roar and charge backwards from where you came from, towards the source of the voices. With bloodlust filling your eyes you turn the corner, charging at the source of the voices. You round the corner yelling Russian obscenities and raise your vodka bottle ready to take on the attackers. The two voices turn out to be two men, a younger looking man and older one. Just as you are about to swing at the young man, he grabs your arm and slams you into the wall. The old man calls you a spy and begins to kick you, asking if you would like a taste of American fury. Hungry and unsure of this American dinner ritual you reply yes.  Your arm starts to hurt, and as you try to twist away, the younger man kicks you in the head and the world starts to fade to black. Before you black out you hear the older man exclaim “Nice kick Mr. President.”</p>
              <p class="lead">
When you come to you find yourself strapped to a chair. You’re blindfolded and don’t know where you are but you do realize that the next few days will not be a pleasant experience.  You feel your stomach clenching and unknown to you, you’re in an airplane.  You hear the monotonous hum of an engine as you await your death.  You think you have no way out.  You’re trapped, but when you move your body around, you realize you still have a fragment of your vodka bottle on you.  It’s nothing significant, but you feel relief wash over you as you realize that perhaps you don’t have to give up on hope yet.  You know that with that piece of glass, you could cut yourself out of your restraints, but if you wait, you could attack the people when they transport you next.  Do you try cutting out of your restraints or do you sit quietly?
