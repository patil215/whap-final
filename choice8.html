            <p class="lead">You decide that it’s too late to try and escape. You sit your chair for what seems like hours fading in and out of consciousness. Your head is pounding and the small room seems hot as a desert. On a small table in front of you there are what look like medical utensils covered in blood. Suddenly the door flies open and a large man strolls through the door. In his hands you see a large knife and a hammer. “As he leans in close to you the stink of vodka can be smelt on his breath. “This man is a Russian?!” you think quietly to yourself. “I am Viktor. They call me the Bear” he said dropping the knife to the ground. “I’m here to get information from you, then kill you”. Panic flashes over your eyes. Quickly you tell him that you know nothing and that this all a misunderstanding. Viktor looks at you with eyes of cold hate. WIthout a sound he whips the hammer around and the world fades to black.  </p>
            <p class="lead">
Your eyes slowly open to find yourself in a small cell. You raise you hand to wipe away the sleep in you eyes and find that it hurts to move. You look down at your chest and find hundreds of tiny cuts.What had happened? You try to focus on what had happened but your mind goes blank. As you look around your cell you find a small note on the ground. </p>
<em>
<p class="lead">
You have been sentenced to death for espionage, </p>
<p class="lead">
Your execution will be March 19,1962  </p>
<p class="lead">Sincerely,
Viktor The Bear <p></em>
<p class="lead">
  You sink to your knees and weep. It doesn’t look like you're getting out of this one.
